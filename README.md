# Vmware terraform module

This module was created to fill the need to spawn multiple vm's with very dynamic settings and placement.
I am a terragrunt fanboy, but should work for you vanilla terraformers aswell. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Terraform is the only requirement
```

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
